Semester Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a comprehensive system that enables users to efficiently order daily products from local stores. The system is designed to address the challenge of customers being unaware of the daily product schedules, enabling them to inquire about and place orders for their required items. The solution is built with modular components that facilitate user registration, ordering, inventory management, and more. Here's an overview of the system:

## Key Features

### User Registration and Access
- Users with a Smart card can easily register and access the system.
- User access is crucial for placing orders.

### Pricing Based on Income
- The system incorporates a pricing model based on individual income levels.
- This ensures that customers receive products at minimal cost or even free of charge, reducing inequity.

### Shop Manager Functions
- Shop managers can automate the selection of daily products.
- They can notify customers about product availability.
- Shop managers are responsible for packaging products based on customer order details.

### Order Management
- Managers handle user orders and ensure timely order fulfillment.
- The order management module keeps an updated list of pending orders.

### Ordering Process
- The ordering module provides a user-friendly interface for placing orders.
- It includes various payment modes to complete the order process.

### Inventory Management
- The inventory module stores essential information about available products.
- Users can only select from items currently in stock.
- Managers can update the daily available product list.

### Reporting and Analytics
- The report module offers an overview of order lists for store managers to analyze.

### Billing and Receipts
- Users receive bill receipts for their orders.

### Automated Notifications
- The system sends automated notifications and messages based on user actions and permissions.
